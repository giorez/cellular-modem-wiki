# RM521F-GL
![](./images/rm521.png)

>:warning: The RM521F-GL never made it out of the Engineering Sample phase and is no longer produced. The RM550V-GL is Quectel's new X70 platform modem and does 3xCA NR SA just like the RM521F-GL. It is advisable however, to go for a [RM551E-GL](https://github.com/iamromulan/RM551E-GL/) which is capable of 5xCA on SA NR and is similar in price.

The Quectel RM521F-GL is a cellular NR/LTE (5G/4G) M.2 B-Key modem module specially optimized for a variety of applications and usage scenarios utilizing the Qualcomm x65 platform.

You will find Tools, Docs, and Firmware for it here, as well as a .exe (QuecDeploy) that installs everything for windows.

# Where to buy

Currently the cheapest place I know to purchase an RM521F-GL modem is: [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806095725614.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.67.1ec0cqoxcqoxvk&algo_pvid=3c6eabc4-bc5f-48d9-8b7b-661b7d21bfe6&algo_exp_id=3c6eabc4-bc5f-48d9-8b7b-661b7d21bfe6-31&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2138.95%2138.95%21%21%2138.95%2138.95%21%402103146f17232383989501000edf5f%2112000036597223958%21sea%21US%212731139720%21X&curPageLogUid=9pFh6rndCN3r&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A) for $244 + shipping

Be sure to select the modem itself and not just the adapter board only when purchasing.
