# How to use Qnavigator to send AT commands


Connect your modem to your computer by USB. Either through a USB to m.2 B-key sled (should have a sim slot as well) from Amazon or by using a PCIe RC (RJ45 sled) USB C port.
### If you installed by using [QuecDeploy](#quecdeploy): 
You should already have a desktop icon and start menu shortcut for Qnavigator.
#### 1. Open Qnavagator, you'll be presented with this screen, just press escape (ESC) to skip their directions.
